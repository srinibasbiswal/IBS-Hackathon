# IBS TRAVEL HACKATHON

*Institute of Technical Education and Research , Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (DEEMED TO BE UNIVERSITY)*

## Problem
```
While we book railway tickets for a journey, we do have no idea regarding where our seats would be and which berth we may fall in. The situation becomes worse when we travel in a group and most of the members are in one berth, while few others fall in a different berth, becoming lonely and the journey becomes boring for them as they can’t interact and enjoy with the rest of the group.
In such situations, most often we have to persuade other people who share the same berth as ours, to exchange with the other members of our group. And many a times the other group don’t agree to change at that moment, creating problems.
 ```

## Solution
```
We’ve thought of  an idea, that would result into a web-app, that would allow users to see their seat status(location of their seat) and if they find it’s in a different place from other members of their group, then they can talk/chat, via the app, with the strangers, who are scheduled to travel with the members of our group and try persuade them to exchange their seats, much time before the journey. So, basically, it would have a chat app, that would be used by users to interact with others, regarding seat or berth exchange.
```

## MAIN HIGHLIGHTS
```

* Concept of Block chain- To be used for booking and exchanging seats, as it provides transparency to the user as well as travel service         provider, so that would avoid black market.
* AADHAR Card- Unique identification, through aadhar to be used while signing up and booking tickets, to avoid forgery of tickets, so that only  one ticket is allotted to one traveler.
* Food Services- While on train, we hardly find good network strength, making it difficult to communicate or place or orders for food. By this   we can pre-book our meals, which can be delivered at our desired station.
* Train Wallet- Introducing train wallet, which user can earn by exchanging seats that can be used for ticket booking.

```

## FACILITIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED
```
* Sign up & Log in
* Browsing the available trains
* Booking & Payment portal
* Status of your allotted seat
* View whole train status
* Request to swap / exchange seats
```
